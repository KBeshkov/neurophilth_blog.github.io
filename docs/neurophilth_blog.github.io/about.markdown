Hey, I am a PhD student working on modelling of visual cortex and developing algorithms with which to understand the neural code at the Univiersity of Oslo. I made this blog to get better at writting and to hopefully inspire people from any background to understand neural computation in a clear way. I might try to do some math or philosophy related posts, but most of the posts will be about unconventional (and probably unrealistic) neural network architectures and computations.
