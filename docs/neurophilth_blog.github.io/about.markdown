Hey, I am a student, currently looking for Phd positions in theoretical neuroscience labs. I made this blog to get better at writting and to hopefully inspire people from any background to understand neural computation in a clear way. I might try to do some math or philosophy related posts, but most of the posts will be about unconventional (and probably unrealistic) neural network architectures and computations.
